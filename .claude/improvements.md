Performance and Efficiency Review: Clinical Canvas React Application
1. Frontend Bundle Size and Code Splitting
All Pages in Initial Bundle: Currently, every page component (Dashboard, PatientsList, PatientDetail, etc.) is imported and rendered in the main App router upfront
GitHub
GitHub
. This means the entire application’s code ships in the initial JavaScript bundle, which increases download size and initial load time. Recommendation: Implement route-based code splitting. Use React.lazy() and <Suspense> for page components so that only the code for the current route is loaded initially. For example, instead of static imports, dynamically import each page (const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'))) and wrap routes in a <Suspense fallback={<Loading/>}> component. This will create smaller chunks and defer loading of pages until needed, improving initial render performance.
Lazy-Load Heavy Components: Identify any large or rarely used components/assets and load them on demand. For instance, the charting library (Recharts) is included in dependencies
GitHub
 but not visibly used in the UI. If charts will be used, consider loading the chart component only when needed (e.g. in a reports page) to avoid pulling in that library for all users. Similarly, the framer-motion library (used for the ArcSpeedDial animations) is relatively heavy
GitHub
. By code-splitting routes (as above), framer-motion’s code will only load on pages that use the speed dial (e.g. patient detail) and not in the initial dashboard bundle.
Asset Optimization: Ensure static assets are optimized. Although this app doesn’t appear to serve large images or videos, any images (e.g. logos or future patient photos) should be compressed and sized appropriately. Use modern image formats and let Vite’s asset handling generate optimized versions if possible. Also consider using lazy-loading for images (e.g. <img loading="lazy" />) so offscreen images don’t block initial render. Tailwind CSS is already configured with purge options to remove unused styles in production
GitHub
, which keeps CSS bundle small. Verifying that PurgeCSS is effectively removing unused styles (especially given the many UI component classes) is worthwhile for bundle size health.
2. React Rendering Patterns and Re-Renders
Unnecessary Re-Renders on Filtering: In the Patients list, search and filter state changes cause the entire list to re-render on each keystroke. The code calls getFilteredPatients() on every render to filter an array of patients
GitHub
, and then maps to <PatientCard> elements
GitHub
. This could become expensive if the patient list grows. Recommendations: Debounce the search input updates and memoize filter results. For example, wrap the search input’s onChange handler so it updates state after a short delay (e.g. 300ms) instead of on every keystroke. Also use useMemo to compute the filtered patient list only when relevant inputs (search query, selected filters, or the patient data array) change. This prevents recomputing the filter on unrelated state updates. In code, that might look like: const filteredPatients = useMemo(() => filterPatients(patients, searchQuery, filters), [patients, searchQuery, filters]). Memoizing ensures the filter logic isn’t re-run unless necessary, reducing CPU work.
Stabilize Component Props: Avoid recreating functions or objects passed to child components on each render, as it can trigger unnecessary re-renders. For example, in the patient list map, the onClick={() => navigate('/patients/${id}')} callback is defined inline
GitHub
, which means a new function instance on every render. If PatientCard were a React.memo component, it would still re-render because the onClick prop changes each time. Recommendation: use useCallback for handlers that are passed down, e.g. const handleOpenPatient = useCallback(id => navigate(/patients/${id}), [navigate]); and then use onClick={() => handleOpenPatient(patient.id)}. Similarly, if you pass objects/arrays as props, consider useMemo to provide stable references. This helps React’s reconciliation avoid re-rendering child components that haven’t truly changed.
Optimize Expensive Operations: Identify any heavy computations or frequent updates inside components and optimize them. In this app, most components are UI-centric, but for example, the Dashboard performs multiple array operations (mapping and filtering patients/tasks) on every data refresh
GitHub
. If these become slow with more data, consider optimizing the logic (e.g., pre-aggregating data on the server or using web workers for very heavy calculations). Additionally, the scroll listener in PatientDetail toggles a state on every scroll event
GitHub
 to show a sticky header. This is fine, but if more logic is added on scroll, throttle the scroll handler (use requestAnimationFrame or lodash.throttle) to limit how often state is updated (e.g., update isScrolled at most 5-10 times per second). Throttling expensive event handlers can prevent performance jank during rapid events.
Memory Leak Prevention: Ensure that effects cleaning up or aborting asynchronous work to prevent setting state after unmount. Currently, data fetching with fetch doesn’t use an abort signal. For instance, if a user navigates away from Patient Detail quickly, the api.patients.get(id) promise might resolve after the component unmounts and try to call setPatient
GitHub
. This can trigger React warnings. Recommendation: use an AbortController to cancel fetches on cleanup. In the useEffect for data load, create a controller and pass controller.signal to fetch; on component unmount, call controller.abort() to prevent the response from calling setState. This pattern improves stability in fast navigation scenarios.
3. Data Fetching with React Query (Caching & Updates)
Lack of Caching: The app initializes a React Query QueryClient at the top level
GitHub
 but does not leverage useQuery or useMutation in the components. Data is fetched imperatively with api calls in useEffect and stored in local component state (e.g. PatientsList uses useState for patients and calls api.patients.list() on mount
GitHub
). This approach means every time a component mounts, it refetches data even if it was recently fetched elsewhere. Recommendation: Use Tanstack React Query to manage server state. For example, in PatientsList, replace the manual effect with const { data: patients, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['patients'], api.patients.list). This will automatically cache the patient list. When the user navigates away and back, React Query can return cached data immediately (for a faster UI) and optionally refetch in the background if the data is stale. This reduces redundant network calls and provides a single source of truth for data across components.
Effective Query Keys: Structure query keys to capture data scope. For instance, use ['patients'] for the patient list, ['patient', id] for individual patient detail, and ['tasks', patientId] for tasks of a patient. In the current code, the Patient Detail page fetches the patient and then their timeline in sequence
GitHub
. With React Query, you could do parallel queries with useQuery(['patient', id], ()=>api.patients.get(id)) and useQuery(['timeline', id], ()=>api.patients.timeline(id)), or even use the useQueries hook to run them together. This would also make it easier to cache and reuse timeline data if the user revisits that patient.
Prefetching and Invalidation: Take advantage of React Query’s prefetching and invalidation APIs for a smoother UX. For example, when navigating from the patients list to a Patient Detail page, you can prefetch the patient data so it’s ready by the time the page loads. This can be done by calling queryClient.prefetchQuery(['patient', id], ()=>api.patients.get(id)) on link hover or click. After a mutation (e.g., adding a patient or marking a task complete), use invalidation to refresh relevant queries. In AddPatientForm, after successfully creating a patient, the code calls the parent’s onAddPatient callback to add it to local state
GitHub
GitHub
. With React Query, you could instead invalidate the ['patients'] query (queryClient.invalidateQueries(['patients'])) or optimistically update it via queryClient.setQueryData. This way, the patients list would include the new patient on next view without a full refetch (or with a refetch in the background). Similarly, when a task is marked done in PatientTasks, you currently update local state after the API call returns
GitHub
. With useMutation, you could optimistically update the task’s status in the cache and use invalidateQueries(['tasks', patientId]) to refetch or confirm the update.
Stale Data and Refetching: Configure cache stale times according to app needs. By default, React Query considers data stale immediately (which would trigger refetch on each mount). You can set a staleTime (e.g. a few minutes for patient lists if real-time accuracy is not critical) to avoid too-frequent refetching. In the Dashboard, you manually refresh data every 60 seconds with setInterval
GitHub
. This could be handled by React Query’s refetchInterval option on a query (which auto-refetches at a set interval as long as the component is mounted). It also pauses when the window is hidden to save resources. Using React Query here would simplify the interval logic and ensure data consistency (for example, you could have a single query for ['patients'] that Dashboard, PatientsList, and other components all subscribe to, so that one interval or one initial fetch populates data for all). In addition, React Query will refetch on window focus by default – a useful feature to get fresh data when the user returns to the app.
Error Handling via Query: React Query provides centralized error handling and loading state management. The current code often just console.error on fetch failures (e.g., in PatientsList and PatientTasks)
GitHub
GitHub
, which isn’t visible to the user. By using useQuery, you get an error object and isError flag. You can show error messages in the UI or use React Query’s global onError callbacks to, for example, show a toast notification whenever a network request fails. This would improve the user experience by not failing silently. You could also integrate React Query DevTools (as a development-only dependency) to monitor query behavior and performance during development.
4. API Integration Efficiency and Validation
Centralized API Client: The project uses a central api module for all requests
GitHub
GitHub
, which is a good practice. The request helper consolidates fetch logic and error handling in one place
GitHub
. One improvement is to handle common failure cases globally. For instance, if the API returns a 401 Unauthorized (perhaps when an auth token expires), the request function could intercept that and trigger a logout or token refresh across the app. Currently, such logic would have to be handled in every .catch (which is error-prone). Centralizing it would improve reliability.
Runtime Data Validation: The app uses Zod for form input validation (e.g. AddPatientForm schema)
GitHub
GitHub
, but it doesn’t validate API responses. Relying on the backend without validation can lead to runtime errors if the API returns unexpected data (for example, missing fields or wrong types). Recommendation: Consider using Zod (or TypeScript’s as + runtime checks) to validate critical API responses. For example, you could define PatientSchema and use PatientSchema.parse(data) after a fetch to ensure it matches the expected shape. This is especially useful for catching integration issues early, and it can be done in development mode only to avoid performance overhead in production. Another lightweight approach is to use TypeScript’s api types (in @/types/api.ts) to at least ensure you access known fields; however, that doesn’t guard against malformed data at runtime. Zod or a similar schema can bridge that gap.
Reducing Network Calls: Look for opportunities to reduce the number of API calls, especially in high-level views like the Dashboard. The Dashboard currently fetches all patients, then fetches each patient’s tasks list individually to compute open tasks count
GitHub
. This could be very inefficient if there are many patients (N+1 calls). Suggestions: If possible, modify the backend API to provide aggregate data. For example, an endpoint that returns the total open tasks or urgent alerts across all patients (or for a department) would avoid fetching each list. In fact, the api.tasks.listByDepartment method is defined
GitHub
 and could be used to get all tasks in one call (filterable by status and assignee). Using that in the Dashboard would replace looping api.tasks.list(p.id) for each patient with a single request. If the backend doesn’t support that yet, consider adding such endpoints or using a serverless function to aggregate data. At the very least, implement some form of caching or limit the frequency of these calls (which React Query could assist with as noted).
Optimistic UI and Reliability: For write operations (create, update, delete), ensure the UI responds immediately when possible. The current approach often waits for the API to succeed before updating the UI. For example, adding a new note navigates back to the patient detail page only after the API call succeeds
GitHub
 (with no user feedback on failure except a console error). Implementing optimistic updates or at least a loading state can improve perceived responsiveness. E.g., when “Save Note” is clicked, you might immediately append the new note to the UI (in a pending state) or show a spinner, rather than nothing. If the API fails, you can then show an error message (and remove the pending note if it was optimistically added). Similarly, when marking a task as done, the UI currently updates only after the API call returns
GitHub
. If network latency is high, the user might wonder if the click registered. An optimistic approach would mark the task as done in the UI immediately (perhaps with a subtle pending indicator) and revert it if the server call fails.
Use of Fetch vs. Axios: The api.ts uses the Fetch API directly, which is fine, but note that fetch has no built-in timeout and requires manual abort handling. For better network reliability, consider setting a reasonable timeout on requests (especially for critical interactions). You can implement this by using Promise.race between fetch and a timeout promise, or using a library. If more advanced features are needed (interceptors, request cancellation, automatic JSON parsing, etc.), you might consider switching to a library like Axios or leveraging React Query’s features. However, given the current scale of the app, the simple fetch wrapper is sufficient; just ensure you handle exceptions (like network failures) by showing user-friendly error messages (e.g., “Unable to reach server. Please check your connection.”) rather than failing silently.
5. Build Tools and Vite Configuration
Development vs Production Behavior: The app is built with Vite (and the React SWC plugin for fast HMR)
GitHub
. The Vite config includes a proxy for API calls in development
GitHub
, directing "/api" requests to a local or remote backend. This is a good setup for avoiding CORS issues during dev. Make sure that in production, the API base URL is configured appropriately (currently it uses VITE_API_BASE_URL which defaults to "/api"
GitHub
). In a production deployment (e.g. on Vercel), you’ll likely either have a reverse proxy or the front-end and API under the same domain path. It’s worth testing the production build (npm run build and npm run preview) to confirm that API calls still work (the proxy only applies in dev). If not, you might need to adjust VITE_API_BASE_URL for production or configure the hosting to serve the API under /api.
Hot Module Reloading Performance: Thanks to the SWC plugin, development rebuilds are fast. If the app grows significantly, HMR updates could slow down especially if the app is one large bundle. Code-splitting (as recommended above) not only helps bundle size in production, but also isolates modules in development – changing code in one lazy-loaded module will reload only that chunk, not the entire app. This can improve dev feedback loop times. Also, ensure that unnecessary sources aren’t watched by Vite (the config as given looks fine, watching src/ by default). If you encounter slow rebuilds, consider using Vite’s profiling or inspector tools to see what might be bottlenecking.
Vite Plugins and Config: The current config is minimal, which keeps build complexity down. One thing to consider is using the official Vite Visualizer plugin or --analysis flag on builds occasionally to analyze bundle composition. This can reveal if any single chunk is unusually large or if any dependency is pulling in more than expected. For example, you may find that including all Radix UI components added some overhead, or that framer-motion could be a large part of a chunk. With that knowledge, you can adjust (e.g., split vendor chunks). Vite’s Rollup underpinning allows manual chunk splitting via the build.rollupOptions config if needed – for instance, forcing heavy libraries into a separate chunk that can be cached long-term. At this stage it may not be necessary, but it’s a tool to keep in mind if performance testing shows a need.
Source Maps and Deployment: By default, Vite will generate source maps for production builds (usually hidden by default). Including source maps is useful for debugging, but they do increase the build output size. Ensure that these maps are either not deployed or are hidden (so users don’t download them unnecessarily). Vercel, for instance, can be configured to ignore *.map files in production deploy or you can generate them as separate artifacts. This doesn’t impact runtime performance for users (source maps aren’t loaded unless dev tools open), but it affects bandwidth. Also verify that tree-shaking is working: the absence of any import of unused Radix components in code should mean they’re dropped from the bundle. It’s still good to double-check that no dev-only code (like the Vercel SpeedInsights component) is included in production. Tip: You might conditionally import/render such developer aids. For example, wrap <SpeedInsights /> in a check for import.meta.env.DEV so it doesn’t run in production, since gathering performance metrics might have a slight overhead
GitHub
.
Build and CI Efficiency: The project uses TypeScript and ESLint (as seen in package scripts). To maintain efficiency, integrate these into your development/CI process. Running npm run lint (ESLint) and tsc --noEmit for type-check as part of a pre-commit or CI pipeline can catch issues early, preventing slow debug cycles. Vite’s build is already quite fast, but consider using continuous integration to build the app on each pull request – this will catch any build-time errors or significant bundle size increases early. Vercel’s automatic deployments already build the app; adding a GitHub Action for running tests/lint can complement that by ensuring code quality before deploy.
6. Component Structure and Reusability
Custom Hooks for Repeated Logic: The codebase has a few patterns repeated across components that could be abstracted for better reusability and maintainability. For example, multiple components fetch patient data on mount (PatientDetail, AddTask, AddNote all call api.patients.get(id) in a similar useEffect
GitHub
GitHub
GitHub
). You could create a usePatient(patientId) custom hook that returns patient data (and loading/error state), using either React Query or internal state. This would remove duplication and ensure all components load patient info consistently (and benefit from caching if using React Query). Similarly, a hook like useDoctors(department) could fetch and cache doctor lists, instead of doing it in AddTask and potentially other places.
Global State for Common Data: The app presently uses context minimally (mostly for Radix UI or theme). Consider if some data or state should be lifted globally. For example, the current doctor/user ID is hard-coded in a couple places (e.g., currentDoctorId = 'doc-abc123' in PatientsList
GitHub
 and a currentDoctor name in CompletedToday
GitHub
). In a real app, this would come from an auth context or user store. Introducing a context for the logged-in user (with their ID, name, role, etc.) would make the app ready for multi-user scenarios and remove the need for hard-coded identifiers scattered around. It would also allow components like PatientsList or CompletedToday to automatically filter data for “my patients” or “my tasks” based on the actual current user without passing props down through many layers.
Memoizing Large Lists and Components: In general, React reconciliation is efficient, but when rendering large lists (hundreds of items), consider using React.memo for item components to avoid re-rendering unchanged items. For instance, PatientCard could be wrapped in React.memo since it simply displays props and its own internal state. If the parent list re-renders but a given patient object is the same (no prop changes), a memoized PatientCard would skip re-render. Currently, however, note that PatientCard’s onClick is an inline function prop
GitHub
 which changes on every parent render, so memoizing without also stabilizing that prop (via useCallback) would not be effective. If you apply both techniques (memo + stable props), it can reduce unnecessary DOM updates when, say, toggling a filter that doesn’t affect all items. Similarly, consider memoizing other pure components (those that just render props). But be mindful: not everything needs memo – use it primarily for lists or frequently re-rendered subtrees where profiling shows “wasted” renders.
Prop Drilling and Context: Examine if any props are being drilled through many layers, which could be simplified by context or component composition. For example, if Header or BottomBar needed access to global info (like user or theme), providing that via context would be cleaner than passing down multiple levels. In the current code, this isn’t a huge issue because the structure is fairly flat (pages import Header directly). But as the app grows, keep an eye on prop drilling. Using context for global concerns (user, theme, settings) and using component props for local, specific data is a good balance.
Reusable Utility Components: The app uses a lot of UI components from Shadcn (Radix UI + Tailwind). Ensure you’re not duplicating functionality that a component could handle. For instance, there is a ViewToggle component for list/grid view switching, and FilterPopup for filters in PatientsList. If similar toggles or popups are needed elsewhere (e.g., tasks view), consider generalizing them or placing them in a common directory so they can be reused. This saves time in development and ensures consistent behavior. Another example: formatting functions for dates and times appear in several places (formatLastUpdated in PatientCard
GitHub
GitHub
, similar relative time logic in Timeline component). It might be useful to extract a date utility module (or leverage date-fns which is already a dependency) to standardize how timestamps are presented (e.g. “Just now”, “5h ago”, “2d ago”). Consistency here improves user experience and avoids duplicating logic.
7. Rendering Performance: Lists, Inputs, and Layout Stability
Virtualize Long Lists: If the number of patients, tasks, or notes can grow large, the current approach of rendering all items could impact performance. For example, mapping through every patient to display a card
GitHub
 will cause a large DOM and slow down interactions if there are hundreds of patients. In such cases, consider using a windowing/virtualization library (like react-window or react-virtualized). These libraries render only the visible items in a scrollable list, recycling DOM elements for off-screen items. This dramatically improves performance for very long lists by keeping the DOM small. In the context of Clinical Canvas, if you expect, say, 1000+ patients or tasks in a list, virtualization would be worth implementing. If typical usage is tens of items, the current simple mapping is fine and avoids the complexity of virtualization. You could also implement a simpler manual pagination or “Load more” approach as an alternative to displaying huge lists at once.
Debounce and Throttle User Input: We touched on debouncing the search field in section 2; this is a key technique to prevent excessive re-renders. Similarly, any text input that filters or triggers API calls should not do so on every character without a delay. For instance, if in the future there’s a search that queries the backend, definitely debounce it to avoid flooding the server with requests. The same principle applies to expensive onScroll or onResize handlers – use requestAnimationFrame or throttle to limit how often layout calculations or state updates happen. By ensuring that these events don’t fire state updates too frequently, you keep the UI responsive even during fast interactions.
Preventing Layout Shift: Layout shift happens when content changes size/position unexpectedly, which can harm the user experience. One area to watch is content loading. In PatientDetail, when data is loading, a simple “Loading...” message is shown
GitHub
. When the data arrives, the full detail view suddenly appears, pushing content down. This is a visible layout jump. Improvement: Use skeleton placeholders or reserved space to mitigate this. You have already applied a partial solution by giving the tab content containers a minimum height (e.g., min-h-[400px] on the Notes/Tasks cards
GitHub
GitHub
) so that the area is somewhat presized. You can extend this by showing skeleton UI elements that mimic the shape of the content. For example, instead of just “Loading...”, show a skeleton patient detail card with gray bars where text would be, and maybe some placeholder badges. This keeps the layout stable and gives a visual cue that content is loading. Libraries like react-loading-skeleton or simply custom CSS animations (using Tailwind classes or keyframes) can achieve this. The same can be done for lists: show a few placeholder cards while the list data loads, so the user isn’t staring at a completely empty screen or a sudden jump when items pop in.
Smooth Transitions: While not strictly performance, adding CSS transitions for adding/removing elements can make the interface feel more responsive. For instance, when filtering patients, if many cards disappear, a staggered fade or slide could soften the update. Radix UI and Tailwind can be combined to add such effects cheaply (Tailwind’s opacity or translate classes with transitions). This doesn’t improve raw performance but improves perceived fluidity. Just be cautious not to animate too many elements at once (which can be janky); a better approach is to animate container opacity or use virtualization so only a subset animates.
8. Third-Party Dependencies Audit
Remove Unused Libraries: Scan the dependencies to ensure each one is truly needed. For example, the package.json lists cmdk (Command Menu) and a plethora of Radix UI components
GitHub
GitHub
. If the project isn’t using some of those Radix components (like Menubar, NavigationMenu, etc.), they can be removed from package.json. Tree-shaking will prevent them from impacting bundle size if they’re not imported, but removing them entirely will speed up install times and reduce the risk of accidentally importing something heavy. Another example is Recharts – if there is no chart being rendered yet, you might drop it for now and add it back when you implement charts. This avoids pulling in a large library in updates or builds unintentionally. Each dependency carries maintenance cost (updates, potential security issues), so keeping the list lean is beneficial.
Check for Duplication: Sometimes projects accidentally include two libraries that serve similar purposes. In this app, it doesn’t appear there are obvious duplicates (for instance, only one date library, one validation library, etc.). But verify that you’re not including both an older and newer version of something, or two libraries that do the same job. For instance, @hookform/resolvers and Zod vs. maybe Yup – here only Zod is used, so that’s fine. Ensure that if you use a utility like lodash, you don’t also separately use a similar library. In Clinical Canvas, no lodash is seen, which is fine because a lot can be done with native JS or smaller utilities.
Bundle Size of Dependencies: Be mindful of large dependencies. Framer Motion, for example, is relatively large. It’s used for the ArcSpeedDial animation
GitHub
GitHub
. If that speed dial is a core feature, the dependency is justified, but if it were only for a trivial effect, you could replace it with CSS or a smaller library. The same applies to icon libraries: lucide-react is used, which is great (it tree-shakes icons). Just ensure you always import icons by name (as you did) rather than importing the entire icon set, to keep bundle size small. For charts (if/when you use Recharts), note that it can add ~100KB. You might consider alternative chart libraries or lazy-loading the chart component route as discussed. A good practice is to periodically run a bundle analyzer on your production build to see the size contribution of each dependency. This can highlight if, say, a seemingly small library is pulling in a large polyfill or if there are multiple copies of a library due to version mismatches.
Upgrade Dependencies Regularly: Keeping libraries up-to-date can bring performance improvements. For instance, React 18+ itself has improvements in rendering. @tanstack/react-query is listed as 5.x which is current. Vite 5 is used, which is good. Periodically check for updates to Tailwind, Radix, etc. – they may include tree-shaking improvements or smaller builds. However, do test thoroughly when upgrading major versions of UI libraries, as styles or behaviors can change.
9. Perceived Performance Improvements (UX Tweaks)
Skeletons and Loading States: As mentioned, adding skeleton components can greatly improve perceived load times. Instead of showing raw text like "Loading..." or blank sections, skeleton screens give users something to look at immediately and set expectation that content is coming. For example, on the Dashboard, when data is loading or being refreshed, you could show grey placeholder cards for the KPI tiles and maybe a spinner in the charts section. In lists, show a few blank card outlines. When the actual data arrives, transition from skeleton to real content seamlessly. This technique keeps users engaged and less likely to think the app is slow or unresponsive.
Prefetching Likely Next Pages: Anticipate user actions and load resources ahead of time. A common pattern is link prefetching – e.g., when a user hovers over a patient name link, start prefetching the PatientDetail data and component code. React Router v6 doesn’t have built-in prefetch on hover, but you can do it manually: on mouseEnter of a list item, call queryClient.prefetchQuery(['patient', id], ...) and perhaps dynamically import the detail page component. Another approach is using <link rel="prefetch"> for critical assets (like if you have a large font file or a PDF that you know the user will open). Vite can be configured to automatically prefetch code-split chunks for child routes; verify if that’s happening by default. If not, you might manually import the route components in advance in certain contexts (or use React Router’s newer data APIs if applicable). The key is to use idle time to load things that the user is very likely to need next.
Use Suspense Boundaries for Granular Loading: With React 18, you can have multiple <Suspense> boundaries in different parts of the UI to avoid blocking the entire page on one slow component. For instance, on Patient Detail, you might wrap the <PatientTasks> or <PatientNotes> in their own <Suspense> with a small spinner or placeholder. That way, if notes take longer to load than the overview, the overview tab can still display quickly while notes show a loading indicator within that tab. This creates a more layered loading experience: core content first, supplementary content as it arrives. If adopting React Query, you can enable suspense: true in queries to tie into React’s Suspense mechanism (so the query’s promise will trigger the Suspense fallback). This can simplify the loading state handling in your components (you won’t need explicit if (isLoading) checks – the Suspense boundary handles it). Just ensure to also have error boundaries in place if you use this pattern, since Suspense for data will throw promise rejections to be caught by an error boundary.
Error Boundaries and Fallback UI: At the moment, if an error occurs (e.g., network failure or an exception in rendering), the app may either do nothing visible or crash the entire React app. It’s important to have an error boundary at least at a high level (perhaps wrapping the entire router) to catch any rendering errors and display a friendly error message or page. React has the <ErrorBoundary> API (as a class component or using libraries like react-error-boundary). Implement a fallback UI that says something like "Something went wrong. [Retry]" if an unexpected error happens. For data fetching errors, you can also handle those per component: for example, if patient data fails to load, you currently navigate back to the patient list
GitHub
. A better UX might be to stay on the page and show an error message with a retry button, allowing the user to attempt to reload the patient without losing context. Likewise, if saving a form fails, use the toast system (already integrated with Sonner) to alert the user instead of failing silently. These patterns ensure the user is always informed and can take action, rather than feeling the app is unresponsive.
Progress Feedback: For multi-step or long-running operations (if any), provide inline progress. For example, if adding a patient triggered a large file upload or some heavy process, a progress bar would be warranted. In this app, most operations are quick API calls, so simple loading spinners on buttons (like the "Saving..." state you have for AddPatientForm’s submit button
GitHub
GitHub
) are sufficient. Continue this practice for any action that takes more than a couple of seconds. Additionally, consider a global loading indicator for page transitions if needed. Some apps use a top progress bar (like NProgress) or a spinner in the header when navigating between pages that require data load. React Router v6 doesn’t have a built-in loading bar, but you can achieve it by setting some global state in fetch triggers. This is a nice-to-have if users often switch pages and might wonder if the app is doing something.
10. Other Considerations (Testing, CI/CD, Source Structure)
Automated Testing: Currently, the repository has no test files or testing framework configured (no Jest or Vitest in package.json). Adding tests can improve confidence when making performance refactors. For example, after refactoring to use React Query or optimizing a component, unit tests and integration tests ensure you haven’t broken functionality. Start by writing tests for critical pure functions (like filtering logic in getFilteredPatients, or utility functions like formatLastUpdated in PatientCard
GitHub
). You can also write React component tests for things like “adding a patient should show up in the list” (possibly using React Testing Library and MSW to mock API calls). Testing performance specifically (like ensuring a component does not re-render unnecessarily) can be done with React’s test utils (assert the number of renders) or with profiling, but that’s advanced. At minimum, having a regression test suite will catch any major issues introduced during performance tuning.
Continuous Integration Pipeline: Integrate a CI workflow that runs linting, tests, and perhaps build size tracking on each commit. This way, any performance regression (like a bundle size jump or a slower test) can be caught early. There are tools that can fail a build if bundle size exceeds a threshold, which helps maintain the performance budgets. Since deployment is to Vercel, you could also use Vercel’s checks or GitHub Actions to run Lighthouse CI on each deployment preview. Lighthouse can give performance scores and asset sizes; you could monitor these over time. This ensures that as new features are added, the app remains efficient.
Source Maps and Monitoring: For production, consider using an error monitoring service (Sentry, etc.) that can use source maps to report stack traces. This ties into performance because it helps identify if any runtime errors are occurring that might disrupt user experience (for example, an uncaught error that breaks out of a rendering loop could halt subsequent rendering). Having insight into client-side errors can indirectly improve perceived performance by allowing you to fix bugs that might otherwise degrade the app’s responsiveness or correctness. Just ensure to upload source maps to the monitoring service and not serve them publicly.
Source Structure and Module Organization: The current source structure (pages, components, lib, types) is logical and clean. As the app grows, maintain this modular structure. Keep an eye on files that grow too large or do too much – those might benefit from splitting into smaller components or hooks. For instance, if Dashboard gains more features (graphs, tables, etc.), break those into subcomponents rather than one massive file. This modular approach makes it easier to code-split and to reason about performance (since you can profile or optimize a specific subcomponent in isolation).
Profiling and Performance Monitoring: In addition to manual testing, utilize React’s built-in Profiler (in React DevTools) in development to track rendering times and identify “hot” components that re-render frequently. You can wrap parts of the app with <Profiler> to log timings. This can quantitatively confirm improvements (e.g., “after adding memo, PatientCard renders dropped from X ms to Y ms”). In production, if needed, you can measure user performance via the Vercel Analytics (the SpeedInsights component you included) or Google Analytics with performance marks. Since @vercel/speed-insights is included

, use it to gather real user metrics (like TTFB, CLS, FID). It might show, for example, if Largest Contentful Paint is high on certain pages, indicating an image or chunk is slow. Use that feedback to target optimizations (e.g., preloading that image or splitting that chunk).
By implementing these recommendations, the Clinical Canvas application should see improvements in both raw performance and the user’s perception of speed. Code-splitting and caching will reduce unnecessary work and load, while careful UI/UX touches (debouncing, skeletons, error messages) will make the app feel snappier and more robust. Each change should be measured and tested, but collectively they will contribute to a faster, more scalable, and more developer-friendly application

. Keep iterating and profiling as new features are added, and the app will stay performant even as complexity grows. Good luck! Sources:
