# Context Engineering Framework

**Frontmatter contract** (must appear on all pages):
- `title`, `role`, `status`, `owner`, `lastReviewed`
- `tags` and `scope` (one of: frontend|backend|architecture|infra|users|data)
- optional: `summary`, `links`, `related`

**Routing guidelines** for agents:
- Low-hanging features → product/ + roadmap + known-issues + recent changelog days
- Arch decisions → architecture/adr/ + overview + implementation
- Release notes → changelog/versions/ first, then months/days
