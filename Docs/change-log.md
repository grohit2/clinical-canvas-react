Performance Optimization – Faster document retrieval and rendering.

Feature Enhancements – Photo upload system with mobile support and streamlined workflows.

2. Major Issues Identified & Resolved
Issue 1: Slow Document Loading (2+ seconds)

Cause:

Frontend FileGrid component made redundant API calls.

Images loaded directly from S3 instead of CloudFront CDN.

Fix:

Backend modified to enrich documents with cdnUrl.

Frontend switched from FileGrid → new DocumentGrid optimized for CDN.

CloudFront integrated for edge delivery.

Issue 2: Missing Upload Capability

Cause: No way for users to upload photos/documents.

Fix: Added PhotoUploader component, category-specific upload buttons, and a Floating Action Button (FAB) that launches a category selector modal.

3. Technical Changes
Backend (Node.js on AWS Lambda)

Enhanced /documents API to return cdnUrl for each file:

const CF_DOMAIN = process.env.CF_DOMAIN || "";
function makeCdnUrl(s3Key) {
  return CF_DOMAIN ? `https://${CF_DOMAIN}/${s3Key}` : null;
}


Impact:

All documents now load via CloudFront → fast & cached.

Eliminated redundant API calls.

Frontend (React + TypeScript)

New DocumentGrid Component

Displays patient documents with CDN URLs.

Error handling (fallback when images are invalid).

Lazy loading for performance.

DocumentsPage Refactor

<DocumentGrid
  documents={getCategoryDocuments(docs, categoryParam)}
  detachable
  docCategory={categoryParam}
  onDetached={() => refresh()}
/>

4. Photo Upload System
Components

PhotoUploader (/src/components/PhotoUploader.tsx)

3-step upload:

Request presigned URL from backend.

Upload file to S3.

Attach metadata to DynamoDB.

Features: progress bar, multi-file, error handling, mobile camera support.

CategorySelector (/src/components/CategorySelector.tsx)

Modal UI for selecting upload target category.

Icons, colors, and touch-friendly design.

Access Points

Category-level "Add Photo" button.

Floating Action Button (FAB) on main page with category modal.

User Flow

Click "Add Photo" or FAB → Select category.

Pick image(s) from gallery/camera.

Upload tracked with progress bar.

Success toast → Auto-refresh → Image appears in grid.

5. Infrastructure & Deployment

AWS S3: Patient files stored under patients/{uid}/optimized/docs/{category}/...

AWS DynamoDB: Metadata + category counts.

AWS CloudFront: Distribution d9j52cd9e77ji.cloudfront.net

Deployment:

sam build
sam deploy --stack-name hms-hyd-dev --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ESSEVO9MR5W3 --paths "/*"

6. Validation & Testing
Performance Results

Before:

2+ seconds per load.

No CDN, multiple API calls.

After:

~300–500ms load times.

100% CDN usage.

Single API call per page.

CDN Validation
curl -I "https://d9j52cd9e77ji.cloudfront.net/patients/.../image.webp"
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront ✅

Error Handling

Invalid test files (plain text with image extensions) → gracefully display “Document unavailable”.

Logs confirm invalid files rejected correctly.

7. Current System Status

✅ Fully Functional

CDN-optimized document display.

Multi-point photo upload system.

Mobile-friendly UI with camera integration.

Real-time progress, error handling, auto-refresh.

8. Tech Stack

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Lucide Icons, Vite (HMR).

Backend: Node.js 22 (AWS Lambda), API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.

Infra: Deployed via AWS SAM, CloudFront invalidation for fresh updates.

9. Best Practices Established

Use presigned URLs for secure uploads.

Always attach documents via metadata in DynamoDB.

Leverage CloudFront edge caching for speed.

Provide graceful error fallbacks for invalid files.

10. Future Enhancements

Advanced image optimization (resizing, format conversion).

Bulk upload & document management.

Search & filter features.

Audit trail for uploads and modifications.

DICOM integration for medical imaging.

Analytics dashboard (usage, performance metrics).
