Performance Optimization – Faster document retrieval and rendering.

Feature Enhancements – Photo upload system with mobile support and streamlined workflows.

2. Major Issues Identified & Resolved
Issue 1: Slow Document Loading (2+ seconds)

Cause:

Frontend FileGrid component made redundant API calls.

Images loaded directly from S3 instead of CloudFront CDN.

Fix:

Backend modified to enrich documents with cdnUrl.

Frontend switched from FileGrid → new DocumentGrid optimized for CDN.

CloudFront integrated for edge delivery.

Issue 2: Missing Upload Capability

Cause: No way for users to upload photos/documents.

Fix: Added PhotoUploader component, category-specific upload buttons, and a Floating Action Button (FAB) that launches a category selector modal.

3. Technical Changes
Backend (Node.js on AWS Lambda)

Enhanced /documents API to return cdnUrl for each file:

const CF_DOMAIN = process.env.CF_DOMAIN || "";
function makeCdnUrl(s3Key) {
  return CF_DOMAIN ? `https://${CF_DOMAIN}/${s3Key}` : null;
}


Impact:

All documents now load via CloudFront → fast & cached.

Eliminated redundant API calls.

Frontend (React + TypeScript)

New DocumentGrid Component

Displays patient documents with CDN URLs.

Error handling (fallback when images are invalid).

Lazy loading for performance.

DocumentsPage Refactor

<DocumentGrid
  documents={getCategoryDocuments(docs, categoryParam)}
  detachable
  docCategory={categoryParam}
  onDetached={() => refresh()}
/>

4. Photo Upload System
Components

PhotoUploader (/src/components/PhotoUploader.tsx)

3-step upload:

Request presigned URL from backend.

Upload file to S3.

Attach metadata to DynamoDB.

Features: progress bar, multi-file, error handling, mobile camera support.

CategorySelector (/src/components/CategorySelector.tsx)

Modal UI for selecting upload target category.

Icons, colors, and touch-friendly design.

Access Points

Category-level "Add Photo" button.

Floating Action Button (FAB) on main page with category modal.

User Flow

Click "Add Photo" or FAB → Select category.

Pick image(s) from gallery/camera.

Upload tracked with progress bar.

Success toast → Auto-refresh → Image appears in grid.

5. Infrastructure & Deployment

AWS S3: Patient files stored under patients/{uid}/optimized/docs/{category}/...

AWS DynamoDB: Metadata + category counts.

AWS CloudFront: Distribution d9j52cd9e77ji.cloudfront.net

Deployment:

sam build
sam deploy --stack-name hms-hyd-dev --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ESSEVO9MR5W3 --paths "/*"

6. Validation & Testing
Performance Results

Before:

2+ seconds per load.

No CDN, multiple API calls.

After:

~300–500ms load times.

100% CDN usage.

Single API call per page.

CDN Validation
curl -I "https://d9j52cd9e77ji.cloudfront.net/patients/.../image.webp"
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront ✅

Error Handling

Invalid test files (plain text with image extensions) → gracefully display “Document unavailable”.

Logs confirm invalid files rejected correctly.

7. Current System Status

✅ Fully Functional

CDN-optimized document display.

Multi-point photo upload system.

Mobile-friendly UI with camera integration.

Real-time progress, error handling, auto-refresh.

8. Tech Stack

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Lucide Icons, Vite (HMR).

Backend: Node.js 22 (AWS Lambda), API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.

Infra: Deployed via AWS SAM, CloudFront invalidation for fresh updates.

9. Best Practices Established

Use presigned URLs for secure uploads.

Always attach documents via metadata in DynamoDB.

Leverage CloudFront edge caching for speed.

Provide graceful error fallbacks for invalid files.

10. Future Enhancements

Advanced image optimization (resizing, format conversion).

Bulk upload & document management.

Search & filter features.

Audit trail for uploads and modifications.

DICOM integration for medical imaging.

Analytics dashboard (usage, performance metrics).

    - Floating action button with validation
  8. 🔧 Technical Improvements
    - Proper data mapping from existing patient records
    - Form validation for required fields
    - Error handling with toast notifications
    - Clean API payload construction
    - Type-safe implementation

  Form Validation & Data Flow:

  - ✅ Validates mandatory fields (name, age, sex, MRN, department)
  - ✅ Properly populates existing patient data
  - ✅ Maps between UI representation and API format
  - ✅ Handles missing/incomplete patient data gracefully
  - ✅ Provides real-time validation feedback

  The enhanced EditPatient page now provides users with the complete patient add view with all details populated as requested, and includes all the missing fields that were identified in the
  gap analysis between the patient schema and the original simple edit form.

  Users can now edit patients with the same comprehensive interface used for patient creation, ensuring data consistency and completeness across the application.

Perfect! Now I've updated the vercel.json to use the correct API endpoint that matches your .env.local file. The vercel.json now points to:

  https://kfzsv6at3amrxzl5kzuehljfju0rhkup.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws

  This should resolve the 403 and 401 errors you were seeing. The mismatch was causing API calls to hit the wrong Lambda URL, which likely resulted in authentication/authorization failures.

  Summary of the fix:

  ✅ Updated vercel.json - Changed API destination from US East (us-east-1) to AP South (ap-south-1) region to match your .env.local configuration
  ✅ API endpoint alignment - Now both local development (.env.local) and production deployment (vercel.json) point to the same Lambda URL

  You'll need to redeploy to Vercel for this change to take effect in production. The 403/401 errors should be resolved once the deployment uses the correct AP South Lambda endpoint.

 Root Cause Analysis

  After thorough investigation, I've identified the root cause of the MRN update issue. Here are the critical problems:

  1. API Schema Mismatch - Patient Creation vs Updates

  Patient Creation API (api.patients.create):
  - Only sends registrationNumber (single MRN) and scheme: "GENERAL"
  - Does not send mrnHistory or latestMrn to backend
  - Location: /src/lib/api.ts:32-56

  Patient Update API (api.patients.update):
  - Converts data to snake_case and sends mrnHistory and latestMrn
  - Location: /src/lib/api.ts:58-62

  2. Inconsistent Form Data Handling

  PatientRegistrationForm (New Form):
  - Has full MRN history support with mrnHistory array
  - Properly builds payload with latestMrn and mrnHistory
  - Uses adapter but API create method ignores these fields

  AddPatientForm (Legacy Form):
  - Only has single registrationNumber field
  - No MRN history support at all

  EditPatient Form:
  - Has full MRN history support
  - Properly handles mrnHistory and latestMrn in updates
  - Works correctly but only for updates

  3. Data Flow Issues

  1. Creation: MRN history is built in frontend forms but never sent to backend
  2. Backend Response: Backend likely only returns single MRN, not history
  3. Frontend Display: MrnOverview component expects mrnHistory array but receives incomplete data
  4. State Management: No data refresh after patient creation in PatientDetail page

  ⎿  Fix MRN Update Functionality

     Issues Identified:

     1. API CREATE endpoint only accepts single registrationNumber, ignoring mrnHistory and latestMrn
     2. Patient Registration Form builds MRN history but it's lost during creation
     3. MrnOverview component shows mock data because backend doesn't return MRN history
     4. PatientDetail page doesn't refresh data after edits, so changes aren't visible

     Fix Plan:

     1. Update Patient Creation API (src/lib/api.ts)

     - Modify api.patients.create to send mrnHistory and latestMrn fields
     - Update the request body to include these fields in the backend payload
     - Ensure consistent data structure between create/update operations

     2. Fix Backend Schema Alignment

     - Update the create endpoint payload to match the DynamoDB schema from docs
     - Send MRN history as structured array with scheme, mrn, and date fields
     - Ensure latestMrn is properly set from the form data

     3. Update PatientRegistrationForm Integration

     - Ensure the adapter properly maps mrnHistory to the API payload
     - Fix any missing field mappings between form and API

     4. Add Data Refresh in PatientDetail

     - Add data refresh when returning from edit pages
     - Ensure MrnOverview receives real data instead of mock data
     - Add proper state management for MRN updates

     5. Make Legacy Form Consistent

     - Update AddPatientForm to support basic MRN history (optional)
     - Or ensure it properly integrates with the new MRN system

     Expected Outcome:

     - New MRN entries added in forms will be saved to backend
     - MRN history will display correctly in patient overview
     - Navigation between MRN labs will work with real data
     - Edit page will show previously entered MRN numbers
