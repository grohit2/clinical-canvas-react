# Inside the Hospital: A Complete Guide to In-Patient Admission and Pre-Operative Workflow

When a patient walks through the hospital doors with a surgical condition, they're about to embark on a carefully orchestrated journey through multiple departments, checkpoints, and procedures. Let me walk you through exactly what happens, step by step, from the moment they arrive until they're wheeled into the operating theater.

## The Beginning: From Outpatient to Inpatient

Let's say a patient arrives at our hospital with a lipoma on their back. The first thing they need to understand is that we categorize patients into two groups: OP (outpatient) and IP (inpatient). Today, we're talking about IP — those who need admission for surgical procedures.

Before we dive deeper, let me explain the three payment schemes available for IP admission. First, there's the paid category for self-paying patients. Second, we have ASP (Aarogyasri), which is a government free scheme for confirmed surgical plans — but you need a government-approved and issued Aarogyasri identity card. Third, there's NAM (Narayana Aarogyamasthu), where half of the laboratory and radiological investigations are free.

So our patient with the lipoma arrives at the OP block. They go to the ground floor reception, take a bill, then come up to the 4th floor for the surgery department. Here, they're issued an OP card — either ASP or NAM, depending on their eligibility.

## The Initial Assessment and Investigation Phase

After seeing the doctor, the patient receives a list of investigations — what we call the surgical profile. This consists of CBP (Complete Blood Picture), RFT (Renal Function Test), CUE (Complete Urine Examination), Serum Electrolytes, Chest X-ray, blood grouping, Bleeding Time, Clotting Time, ECG, and if they're over 45 years old or elderly, a 2D-ECHO.

The patient then goes back to the ground floor to get these investigations done. Once completed, they return to the 4th floor with their results. At this point, the diagnosis is confirmed — in this case, the lipoma — and admission is advised.

## The Admission Process: Moving from OP to IP

Next, the patient takes their OP card with the admission instructions written on it by one of the postgraduates. They go to the general hospital block on the ground floor to issue their file, then head upstairs to the third floor to get admitted. They can choose between a general ward, double sharing, or single sharing room, depending on their priority and choice.

Once admitted, the postgraduates come to take their cases. They write the details on what we call the opening sheet, which includes the diagnosis, patient vitals, all the medications they currently use, and the medications we're supposed to give them.

## The Daily Routine: Repeats and Rounds

Here's where the daily workflow kicks in. We write what we call "repeats" — these are essentially daily progress notes. Every single day in the morning, before the consultant rounds, we write these repeats. If it's a post-op patient or someone in the ICU, we write them twice — once in the morning and once in the evening.

After the patient gets admitted in the ward, the surgical profile is sent. Any other investigations, whether laboratory or radiological, are written down. If the patient has other comorbidities or requires cross-consultation, referral letters are written. The concerned postgraduate from the relevant department is called, or the patient is taken to the OP of that respective department for consultation. Their orders are then followed — if they suggest any investigations, we get them done in the same format, and if they suggest any drugs, we just add them to our repeats.

## The ASP Scheme Process: Documentation and Pre-Authorization

Being a surgical department, if the case falls under the ASP scheme, there's a specific protocol we follow. We need to send three pictures using the GPS camera. The first is the wound or site of interest for surgery. The second is that same site with the patient's face visible. The third shows the patient lying down on the bed.

We send all of these to an employee named Ramesh. Once the lab and radiological investigations are done and the reports are verified and given to us, we go get them stamped with a rubber stamp in their respective departments, then come back and give them to Ramesh.

Depending on the patient's diagnosis, a particular code pertaining to the surgery is searched from a list of procedures that the government offers under their scheme. Ramesh then uploads all those documents, pictures, and the code to the government system. A medical officer on the other side verifies all the documents, approves the case, and grants the funds required. This entire process is called pre-authorization.

## Pre-Operative Clearances: The Multi-Department Checkpoint

The pre-op phase consists of several critical components. First is the pre-anaesthetic checkup (PAC). If the anaesthetist finds anything missing on our checklist for the patient being fit for surgery, they'll make a note. This includes getting fitness clearances from different departments — Cardiology if the patient has a heart condition, Endocrinology if the patient has issues with sugars or thyroid, General Medicine if they have other issues, ENT for airway concerns, and so on.

If there's anything missing on the anaesthetic checkup or the anaesthetist feels something more needs to be done, they write either "review PAC" or "review later." If "review PAC" is written, it means the pre-anaesthetic checkup is going to take a little longer — there are major issues to address. But if it's just "review later," it's going to be pretty fast and could even be done on the day of surgery.

## Preparing the Patient: The Day Before Surgery

To be prepared for surgery, the parts need to be prepared — this means shaving the operative site with a razor. For this, we go to the pharmacist, and they inform the barber who comes upstairs and does the job.

The sisters (nurses) have to give test doses for antibiotics and lignocaine on either of the flexor aspects of the arm. This is to check for any allergic reactions before the actual surgery.

If it's a case requiring general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia, the sisters need to be ordered to put the patient on NBM — Nil Per Mouth. The patient cannot eat or drink anything from midnight before the surgery.

If there are any other investigations that need to be sent as ordered by the anaesthetist, these need to be written in the day's repeat so they can be sent early in the morning at 4 AM the next day.

## The OT List: Coordinating the Surgical Schedule

Information about which OT (Operating Theater) procedures are going to happen needs to be neatly tabulated in a pre-written format and printed out. Copies need to be submitted — one in each ward, two in the OT theater, and one in the post-op theater. This ensures that everybody is informed about the incoming patient and the scheduled procedure.

## The Morning of Surgery

The next day morning, the repeat needs to be written — this is the final progress note before surgery. Also, the OT bill needs to be collected from Ramesh, especially for ASP scheme patients. This completes the pre-operative documentation and ensures all financial clearances are in place.

## Understanding the Case Sheet Zones

Throughout this process, we use a case sheet that's divided into color-coded zones for easy navigation and updating.

The Red Zone contains static patient information — the header of the case sheet with data that rarely changes throughout admission. This includes the case number, date and time, diagnosis (like "Abscess over foot"), the surgical or medical management plan, the consultant-in-charge, baseline vitals and comorbidities, and investigations ordered. This is the "face" of the file, used by doctors, nurses, and billing. Since it doesn't change much, 90% of the time it remains constant.

The Yellow Zone is for dynamic lab values that always change. This is your monitoring zone with GRBS, FBS, PPBS for blood sugar monitoring; HB, WBC, Platelets, RBC for complete blood counts; Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl) for fluid and electrolyte balance; Creatinine and Urea for renal function; and LFT values including Total Protein, Albumin, Bilirubin, SGOT/SGPT, and ALP for liver function. This area gets updated daily or more frequently — it's critical for pre-op fitness, intra-op safety, and post-op monitoring.

The Blue Zone is the checklist section, divided into pre-op orders and post-op orders. Pre-op includes the three GPS clinical pre-pics for surgical documentation, PAC completion, stamps and pre-auth for insurance or government scheme approval, consents and pre-op orders, parts prep and test doses, OT notes, and OT bill. Post-op includes CSI biopsy bill, OT notes with postop findings, intra-op and post-op pics, discharge to ASP updates, post-op stamps and pre-auth, discharge summary, and MLC or radiology reporting if needed. This workflow checklist ensures no medico-legal, billing, or documentation gaps.

The Green Zone handles referrals — inter-departmental referrals to cardiology, endocrinology, anesthesia, radiology, or pathology, plus all the radiology and pathology reporting like USG/CT and biopsy results. Referrals prevent siloed treatment — for example, a diabetic abscess patient will need endocrinology clearance, pathology for pus culture, and radiology for follow-up imaging.

## The Complete Workflow: From Admission to Operating Theater

Let me summarize how all these pieces fit together in the actual workflow. First, the patient is admitted and the Red Zone is filled with their static information. Baseline investigations are conducted and the Yellow Zone gets its first set of entries. The Blue Zone checklist begins with pre-op orders being executed — PAC, consent, OT prep.

Throughout this process, monitoring continues in the Yellow Zone with new labs daily. Referrals in the Green Zone are sought when required. The entire team — residents, nurses, consultants — all cross-check these zones before the patient proceeds to surgery.

This entire system, while complex, ensures that nothing is missed. Every investigation is documented, every clearance is obtained, every financial aspect is sorted, and every team member knows their role. When that patient with the lipoma finally enters the operating theater, we know they're optimally prepared, properly documented, and ready for a safe surgical intervention.

The beauty of this system lies in its redundancy and cross-checks. Multiple people verify the same information, multiple departments provide clearances, and multiple documentation points ensure medical-legal compliance. It's a dance of coordination between departments, a symphony of healthcare delivery where every note must be played perfectly for the best patient outcome.
