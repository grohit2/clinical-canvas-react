# Nexify (Nextra-based living docs)

Single source of truth for product, design, architecture, implementation, processes, **with per-instance changelogs** and **LLM-readable frontmatter**.

- Markdown-first (Obsidian-friendly)
- Context-engineered (frontmatter schema)
- Aggregated changes (day → month → year → version)
