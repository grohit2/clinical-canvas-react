# ADR 0001: Use Nextra (Nexify)

**Context**: Need MD-native docs with clean UX, version control, Obsidian support.  
**Decision**: Use Nextra + `nextra-theme-docs`.  
**Consequences**: 
- Pros: Markdown/MDX, Next.js power, easy theming.
- Cons: Docs versioning is manual â†’ solved via per-instance + aggregators.
